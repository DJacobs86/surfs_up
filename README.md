# Project Overview:
In order to convince investors into investing in a surf/ice cream shop, we had to take a look at the waether trends on the ISland of Oahu. Investors wanted to see data for the months of June and December. This will determine if the shop is sustainable all year long.

## Results:
### June
- Average Temperature 75&#176; with a deviation of 3&#176;
- Minimum Temperature 64&#176;
- Maximum Temperature 85&#176;

### December
- Average Temperature 71&#176; with a deviation of 4&#176;
- Minmum Temperature 56&#176;
- Maximum Temperature 83&#176;

# Summary
December could possibly have some slow days for business with a minimum temperatures in the 50's. Ice cream would have some good sales in December with temperatures in the in the 70's and 80's. The average temperature from Summer and Winter have a difference of 4 degrees, if you ask me (which I have been asked), business looks sustainable year round. Percidpitation is a concern as well that can be analyized.

I have provided charts below for June and December Temperatures and Percidpitation below :
